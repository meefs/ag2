"""Replay invariants for a trimmed span of history.

Every reducer of history — the assembly policies, the limiter middleware, and the
compaction strategies — cuts the event list at an index and replays
``events[cut:]`` to the provider. That tail has to stand on its own, and three
retained events cannot:

| retained event             | required companion             | if missing                      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| tool result                | the **call** it answers        | orphan ``function_call_output`` |
| builtin (server-side) call | its **reasoning** item         | orphan ``web_search_call``      |
| local call event           | the **response** announcing it | maps to nothing at all          |

The remedy differs by caller because what they own differs: a policy or limiter
persists nothing, so it drops the offending event (:func:`replayable_span`);
compaction persists everything it drops, so it moves the cut (:func:`snap`) —
filtering there would leave an event neither retained nor persisted.
